//When you learn about a new method, write a small program to try it out. For example, you can
   //     go right now to your Java development environment and run this program:
public class replace
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String river = "Mississippi";
        System.out.println(river.replace("issipp", "our"));
    }
}
